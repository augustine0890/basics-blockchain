### What is Blockchain?
- __Block__: A block is an individual transaction or piece of data that is being stored within the blockchain.
- __Blockchain__: A blockchain is a continuously growing list (`chain`) of records (`block`), called blocks, which are linked chronologically and secured using cryptography.

The bank transactions can be easily represented in the blockchain. The sender and recipient, as well as the transaction, is stored inside the block and is chained together with other transactions that occurred before and after it.
