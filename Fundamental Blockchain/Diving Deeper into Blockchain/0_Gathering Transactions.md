### Gathering Blockchain Transactions
- As transactions are carried out, they get placed in a special location called the *mempool* that collects all these unvalidated transactions. The latest transactions in the mempool are broadcasted to all blockchain participants.
- Each participant collects these transactions into a new block. However, each block can only hold a limited number of transactions. Therefore, not all transactions can be added to a block at once.
- Once a block is full, the next set of transactions will have to wait in the memory pool. At this point, the block is said to be unconfirmed, and the transactions inside the block are said to be invalidated.

##### Key Terms:
