### The Blockchain Network
- __Blockchain Network__: The blockchain network and blockchain are terms used interchangeably. They represent the entire blockchain from the structure itself to the network that it is a part of.
- __Decentralization__: The concept in which participants work together to validate transactions without relying on a central authority.
- __Participant__: A client that owns a copy of the blockchain and verifies transactions across the network.

In order for a new block to be added, 51% of all of the participants in the blockchain network must verify that the new block is not fraudulent. Once a block has been verified as a valid transaction, it is added to each participantâ€™s copy of the blockchain.
