### Securing the Blockchain Further

- Just like how the bank has an accountant to verify transactions manually, the blockchain has a clever technique called Proof-of-Work that accomplishes two important goals:

    - It makes it difficult for participants to modify blocks by re-calculating hashes.
    - It relies on bulletproof cryptography instead of anonymous participants to verify transactions.

##### Key Terms:

- __Proof-of-Work__: A security feature in blockchain to prevent attackers from easily taking over the blockchain.
- __Trustless__: A feature of blockchain that states how the system doesnâ€™t rely on any participant to verify transactions.
