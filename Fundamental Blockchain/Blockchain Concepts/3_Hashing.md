### Hashing
Blockchain uses a cryptographic hash function, meaning that the output is random but deterministic. This means the same input will always produce the same hash. That process is one-way, so the output (hash) cannot be used to produce the original input.

- __Deterministic__: The same input will always produce the same output, but that output cannot produce the original input.
- __Hash__: A calculated string of letters and numbers produced from a specific input.
- __Hash Function__: A function that takes in an input of a random size, performs hashing on the input, and generates a seemingly random output of a fixed size, also known as the hash.
