### Diving Deeper into Proof-of-Work
- If a dishonest participant decides to tamper with a block, they would have to solve the Proof-of-Work for each subsequent block in order to introduce the tampered block into the network. This is computationally infeasible and almost impossible!
- Furthermore, while the participant is busy finding the Proof-of-Work for each block, newer blocks are being added to the blockchain at a faster rate. The participant soon finds out that they are playing a losing battle against the entire network.
- A block gets increasingly more tamper-proof as newer blocks are added next to it. Proof-of-Work makes it hard to get through the entire blockchain and allow someone to introduce a fake transaction.
- If a particular miner or a group of miners has more computing power and always finds the proof faster than the rest of the network, the the Proof-of-Work will fail.
- If the majority of the network is dishonest, the invalid block will be considered valid and added to the blockchain.
##### Key Terms:

- __Longest Chain__: The most trusted chain with the largest amount of computational work done in calculating the Proof-of-Work.
