### What are Blocks in the Blockchain?

A block contains transaction data and other important details related to the creation of that block, such as the time when it was created and other unique information. In order to create a block, we must have a record that we wish to store.

- __Timestamp__: The time the block is created determines the location of it on the blockchain.
- __Transaction Data__: The information to be securely stored in the block.
- __Hash__: A unique code produced by combining all the contents within the block itself â€” also known as a digital fingerprint.
- __Previous Hash__: Each block has a reference to the block prior to its hash. This is what makes the blockchain unique because this link will be broken if a block is tampered with.
